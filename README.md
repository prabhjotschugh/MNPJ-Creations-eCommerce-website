# MNPJ Creations eCommerce Website
It is an e-Commerce Website built using Django. In the website, user can see various products, create an account and order the products. The payment method that I have integrated in the website is Paypal, and also, C.O.D can be used to confirm the order.

On the admin's panel, the administrator can add products, see the user details, and process the orders.
